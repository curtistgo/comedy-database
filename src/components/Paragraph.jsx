          <p>Hi Folks!</p>

          <p>
            On this site I want to appreciate all comedic writers and actors.
            The database on this page acknowledges some of the greatest comedies
            beginning in the 1970s.

            Comedic movies deserve equal respect as dramatic movies. After all,
            comedy has transformative powers. It has been known to transform
            people with miserable moods into lighter more affable people. Comedy
            is happiness.
